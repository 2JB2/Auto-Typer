Though never a soldier himself, Bari was face to face with war's realities. He remembered instances where Israeli incursions would send waves of panic through the refugee camps, but rather than run away, he and other teachers held their ground, opening their doors and advising their students. I had no other option but to defend my students and my country, even when I knew that we were wrong, he said to me once. He was the one who carried the responsibility, ensuring that learning went on even when violence appeared to destroy everything.

Just as the soldiers in The Things They Carried bore physical and emotional burdens, my father carried the burden of pain by his people. His battle was not one of firearms but one of stamina and determination to safeguard his students' future. Even when war stripped them of their homes and security, he felt that education was the path to reclaiming their dignity and identity. As an educator, I fought not just to stay alive myself, but for my country's future, with the hope that one day they would be returned to their country, he told me.His story reminds me of OBriens words: You can tell a true war story by the way it never seems to end (OBrien 76). The struggle for identity, survival, and education continues even decades later.

Comparing the life of my father, I understand how differently my childhood has been compared to his. I was raised in safety, never for a moment having to fear displacement or war, and yet I too often take for granted the work he did to provide me with this life. He brought his war with him, and in a way, I now bring his story. His strength made me who I am today, teaching me that one generation's struggles provide the next generation's opportunities. Knowing my father's story has helped me value more the opportunities I have today and has forced me to make his sacrifices count by being accountable for what I do.
